# Bellabeat-Case-Study
Bellabeat, a rapidly growing company specializing in health-focused products for women, is poised to expand its presence in the global smart device market. 
I am acting as a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat
I have the responsibility of analyzing consumer smart device usage data for a non-Bellabeat smart device to gain insights into user behavior. I will use this data to provide recommendations on how these trends can inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy and catapult them to be a global player in the smart device market.
